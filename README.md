# Ionic Present: React

Deliver a talk or run a meetup using this pre-built presentation covering Ionic React.

Simply clone this repository, add your info to the "About Me" slide, then present! ðŸŽ‰

The best part? This is a progressive web app (PWA) built using Web Components and [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com) components. ðŸš€

## How to Use

To develop and run locally, just clone the repository, install all dependencies, then start it on localhost:

```
git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/present-ionic-react
cd present-ionic-react
npm install
npm run start
```

This deck can be presented locally (`npm run start`) or hosted online using any static site provider. Ionic recommends [Zeit](https://zeit.co).

## Presentation Tips

* Add your info to the "About Me" slide.
* Each slide contains speaking notes (found in the "notes" slot) - use these as a reference.
* Use the [DeckDeckGo PWA](https://deckdeckgo.app) to control your slides remotely from a mobile device. Open the presentation on a computer, open the DDG PWA on a mobile device, then start presenting!

## Implementation Details

All slides are located in `index.html`. This presentation was built with [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com) - see [the docs](https://docs.deckdeckgo.com) for information on editing slides, components configuration details, etc.
